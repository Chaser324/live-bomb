# Live Bomb!
Live Bomb is a Chrome extension  that notifies you when there's a live video on [GiantBomb.com](http://www.giantbomb.com). It will optionally display a desktop notification with sound when live events start. It can also optionally run in the background even when the browser is closed.

It is customizable, so you can disable sound/notifications/change how often the extension will look for live video and there's a dark and a light theme.
